# Falcão Rios Advogados Challenge

### Introduction
Hello.
If you reach this part of the selection pool, cheers.
This selection's phase will allow us to evaluate your development and PHP skills.
It's a very simple task if you had the expected knowledge on the language. Forget about complex graphs or heavy optimization tasks, at that time. We can find a lot of information about these topics on Google and, if you need that on the job, you can research it.

So, let's talk about the Challenge.
Jorge Falcão, your future boss, ask you to build a small customer contact form. That form will be used by the clients to start services requests, like a letter of attorney or something else.
He needs an interface to manage that requests, reading, filtering and deleting in any time.
Obviously, to finish this task, you need to build a database to save the requests and recover later.

Each request includes a customer name, process ID, request date, subject, request content, and attachments. After the customer sends the request, the code needs to generate a 6-sized random hexadecimal number which identifies the request. The form needs to be sent to the server by Ajax requests. The customer can send one or more files as attachments.

To send your answer for this challenge, fork this repository, finish your implementation and send a pull request to allow us to evaluate your code.

Are Requisites:

  - PHP language
  - Database Conceptual model
  - At least two branches on the implementation
  - At least one merge process
  - Minimum of three commits. Each commit need to contain a small description of the implemented code and the next implementation's step
  - Code documentation (you can choose the best for you)
  - Design Framework (like Bootstrap. You are free to choose the best for you too)
  - All the steps for correct installation/execution of the code need to be informed on a READ.ME file like this. If we can't deploy your code on our server, you'll be eliminated.
 
You can improve your score with:

  - Use of a PHP framework
  - Use of Code Igniter
  - Good code practices
  - Software Engineering Practices and Documentation
